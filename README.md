Decompilations from 100 Smash Win95 Games

This is a set of decompilations from the 100 Smash Win95 Games disc. Some of whatever registered copies existed for these games seem to be gone forever. This is intended for research purposes, gaining knowledge, entertainment and to also support other projects like [VBESVGA](https://github.com/PluMGMK/vbesvga.drv). Please follow the instructions in the subfolder's README.md for more information.
