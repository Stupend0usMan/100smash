# 20 Squares

## Instructions
1. Install Visual Basic 3.0
2. For debugging purposes, you could just run the game as it is. To play the game to it's entirety, you would want to copy the `*.WAV`, `20SQR.HLP`, `20SQR.GID` and `MUMFACT2.TXT` to your installed Visual Basic Folder (e.g. `C:\VB`).

## Generating an executable
1. Go to File, Make EXE File... in Visual Basic.
